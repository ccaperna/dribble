Built for Unity 2018

The player controls the black ball and can move it by rotating the camera and changing the visual (not as easy as it sounds).
The white ball is the enemy and will follow the player in order to push him down the platform. The gem gives big force to the player and it will make it easy to push the enemy down the platform.
If the enemy dies, then will spawn more enemies and more gems. If the player dies, the game is over.
